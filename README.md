The delivered program is a Java-based recommendation system that uses Apache Mahout to suggest products or content to users based on their historical preferences. It works by reading user-item rating data from a CSV file and applying a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm to identify users with similar tastes. The system then generates personalized recommendations by suggesting items that these similar users have liked but the target user has not yet rated . This example demonstrates how AI techniques like collaborative filtering can be implemented in Java to create practical recommendation features often seen in e-commerce platforms and content streaming services.
